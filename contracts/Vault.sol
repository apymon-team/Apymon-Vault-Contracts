/**
 * @title Vault
 * @author Apymon
 *
 * The Vault is responsible for securely handling deposits and withdraws of ETH,
 * ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, and CryptoPunk tokens. A timelock function exists to
 * disable withdraws until after a given time. Instances of the Vault are created
 * by the VaultFactory and, upon creation, ownership is immutably tied to a specific
 * ERC721 token referred to as the key. Anyone can deposit tokens at anytime, while
 * only the Vault's key holder can withdraw or timelock the vault. This effectively
 * ties ownership of all tokens within the vault to the key token.
